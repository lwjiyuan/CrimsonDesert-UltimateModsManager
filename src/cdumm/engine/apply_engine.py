Pipeline:
  1. Ensure vanilla range backups exist for all mod-affected files
  2. Read game files, restore vanilla at mod byte ranges
  3. Apply each enabled mod's delta in sequence
  4. Rebuild PAPGT from scratch
  5. Stage all modified files
  6. Atomic commit (transactional I/O)

Vanilla backups are byte-range level (not full file copies) for files with
sparse deltas. Only the specific byte ranges that mods modify are backed up.
Bsdiff deltas use full file backups (but those files are always small).

    BSDIFF patches — not PAMT bytes. Two failure modes:

    1. Parsing bsdiff binary as PAMT produced garbage headers that
       tripped the paz_count sanity guard, false-flagging every valid
       mod as corrupt.
    2. The bsdiff filename stem (e.g. ``0036_0.pamt``) is non-numeric,
       so ``int(pamt_stem)`` in parse_pamt blew up before any header
       parsing — same failure shape as the v3.1.7 B1 bug.

    Reported as a warning banner on every Apply in issue #38
    (LeoBodnar). A proper version of this precheck would reconstruct
    the modified PAMT bytes via ``bsdiff4.patch(vanilla, delta)`` and
    validate them — that's real work and should land in a later
    release. Meanwhile, B1 (v3.1.7.1) catches corrupt PAMTs at import
    time, and the apply flow's existing error handling catches them
    downstream if a legacy broken delta still exists.
